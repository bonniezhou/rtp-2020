# School of Poetic Computation: Recreating the Past (Spring 2020)

In this course, we will study computational art from the past decades and recreate these works
with contemporary techniques to gain aesthetic, analytical and technical knowledge. The class is led by
artist and SFPC co-founder Zach Lieberman.
